# FXAssignments
School Assignment Manager
This project is intended to allow the user to enter his/her classes and assignments and view them based on their due dates and eventually their importance levels. 

The intention of this project is to learn JavaFx, serialization of objects and get general practice using object oriented design in Java. 
This is also intended to familiarize myself with gitHub and the gitHub desktop app. 

Any contributions, advice and criticisms are welcomed and greatly appreciated.
